# Career Wrapped 2025 📊  
*A personal year-in-review through data analytics*

## Overview
Career Wrapped 2025 is a personal data analytics project where I turned my year into data to better understand how I worked, learned, and grew across 2025.

Inspired by the idea of yearly wrap-ups (like Spotify Wrapped), this project focuses not on highlights alone, but on **patterns** — effort, productivity, stress, burnout, recovery, wins, and losses.

This project uses my own data as a **case study**, but the structure is designed as a **reusable framework** that can be applied to anyone who wants to reflect on their year through data.

## Problem Statement
We often remember our year based on outcomes and highlights, but rarely analyze:
- Where our effort actually went  
- When productivity peaked or dropped  
- How stress influenced performance  
- How burnout and recovery unfolded over time  

This project aims to bridge that gap by using data analytics to convert a year of activity into meaningful insights and reflections.

## Dataset
The dataset represents key phases across the year rather than daily tracking.

**Key features include:**
- Effort hours (scaled to approximate monthly investment)
- Productivity and stress scores
- Focus areas (skills, projects, preparation)
- Outcomes (wins, losses, neutral phases)
- Key highlights and reflections

> Note: Effort hours are aggregated to reflect realistic yearly investment while preserving relative trends.

## Key Insights
- High effort did not always translate to high productivity  
- Burnout followed sustained stress without recovery  
- Breaks helped restore momentum rather than slow progress  
- Hands-on projects led to higher productivity than theory-heavy phases  
- Growth was not linear, but it was consistent over time

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard visualizes:
- Monthly effort trends (burnout → recovery → growth)
- Productivity vs stress relationship
- Dominant focus areas across the year
- Wins, losses, and key moments

This dashboard serves as a visual “Career Wrapped” for the year.

## Framework for Others
While this project uses my personal data, the framework can be applied to:
- Students
- Early-career professionals
- Self-learners

Anyone tracking effort, focus, stress, and outcomes across a year can generate their own “Career Wrapped”.

## Reflection
This project was not about building a perfect dashboard.
It was about ending the year with **clarity instead of assumptions** — using data to understand my own journey better.

## Future Improvements
- User input via forms
- Automated Wrapped generation
- Role-based insights (student, professional, creator)
- Downloadable Wrapped summaries
